## Learning Objectives

* What is OOP
* “first-class everything”
* What is a class
* What is an object and an instance
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is an attribute
* What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
* What is `self`
* What is a `method`
* What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
* What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
* What is a property
* What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
* What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
* How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
* How to bind attributes to object and classes
* What is the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
* How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
* How to use the getattr function

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
* All your classes should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')`
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`

	A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
